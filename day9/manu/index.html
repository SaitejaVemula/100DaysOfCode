    <ol>
      <ul>
        I learned what is the difference between primitives and objects, also
        learned how a JS engine is made of and how does it work,
      </ul>
      <ul>
        JS engine is made of two types of store systems i.e Call stack and Heap
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Call stack stores primitives and HEAP stores reference type elements.

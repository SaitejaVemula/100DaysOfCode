    <h1>100 Days of code: Day 2</h1><br/>
    <pre>This is what tags I've learnt in HTML:-
        <!DOCTYPE html>, <html></html>,
        <head></head>, <body></body>,
        <h1></h1> to <h6></h6>,
        <meta> along with their parameters,
        <p></p>,
        <strong></strong>, <em></em>,
        <sub></sub><sup></sup>,
        <q></q>, <blockquote></blockquote>,
        <code></code>, <img src="" alt="">, <video src="" controls loop autoplay></video>,
        <a href="" target="_blank"></a>,
        <table><th><tr></tr></th></table>,
        <ul type="1"><li></li></ul>, <ol><li></li></ol>,
        <iframe></iframe>
    </pre>

    <pre>This is what I've learnt in CSS:-
        (element name) = element selector
        * = universal selector
        . = class selector
        # = ID selector
        Specificity of Selectors:-
        inline CSS > ID (#)  >  Class(.) > Element (element_name)
        for same selectors, the property which is applied later
        (a.k.a at the bottom of the parenthesis) holds more priority.

        Advanced Selectors:-
        ---------------------
        + -> Adjacent Element Selector (Element 1 + Element 2 = selects every 'Element 2' which directly follows 'Element 1')
        ~ -> Adjacent Sibling Selector (Element 1 ~ Element 2 = selects every 'Element 2' which directly follows 'Element 1', provided both of them are children of the same parent.)
        > -> Direct Child Selector (Element 1 > Element 2 = selects every 'Element 2' which is a child of 'Element 1')
          -> Descendant Selector (Element 1   Element 2 = selects every 'Element 2' which is a descendant (child at any level) of 'Element 1')

        Attribute Selectors:-
        ----------------------
        These allow selection of tags basing upon special attributes.
        e.g.:- h2[class="name"]{} = selects every h2, which has it's class set to "name"

        Pseudoselectors:-
        ---------------------
        => only activate when some kind of interaction is done on the screen (like clicking)
        => represented by (tag name):(pseudoselector)
        e.g. h2:hover{} = does something when we hover the mouse pointer over it
             li:first-child = selects the first child of every list
             li:last-child = selects the last child of every list
             li:nth-child(n) = selects the nth child of every list
             li:only-child = selects the only child of every list that has only one child
             href: link = applies property before the link is clicked on
             href: visited = applies property after the link is clicked on

        Colors:-
        ---------------------
        -> use the 'color' property.
        -> usually rgb and rgba values are used
        -> use 'background-color' to color backgroud.

        Background Image:-
        ---------------------
        url() -> is a function that takes the url of the image as the input
        background-repeat -> chooses whether to 'repeat' or 'no-repeat' the background
